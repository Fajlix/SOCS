### List of the available example codes ###

- **metastable_clusters** : code for Exercises 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, and 9.7. <br /> It creates a live animation of active particles with aligning interactions. It has a user interface with controllable parameters that can be modified in real time.
- **channel_formation** : code for Exercise 9.8. <br /> It creates a live animation of active Brownian particles forming channels in a crowded environment of passive particles. It has a user interface with controllable parameters that can be modified in real time.
